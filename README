Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix. Basically it is a frontend for different search engines (daemons) which provides a unified interface. The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple, using only GTK+2. You can configure it to your needs by using several command line options.

Supported backends are find, (s)locate, doodle, tracker, beagle, strigi and pinot.

Dependencies: PyGtk2, Glade2, python-xdg (optional), dbus (for strigi and pinot)

For installation instructions read INSTALL.
For questions about the search backends please read their specific manuals.

You are encouraged to run 'catfish --help' to check out the various command line options.
